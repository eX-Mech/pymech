title: "Pymech: A Python software suite for Nek5000 and SIMSON"
abstract: |
  Pymech provides a set of high level Python functions which empowers users
  of computational fluid dynamics solvers Nek5000 and SIMSON. It acts as a bridge
  between these Fortran solvers and the scientific Python world. Its key
  functionalities include input from and output to the solvers' binary file
  formats, mesh manipulation, necessary tools for creating initial condition
  files, writing post-processing algorithms and performing other exploratory
  works.

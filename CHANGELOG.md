## [Unreleased]

Supports Python 3.9 and above, from now on to make use of concise
type-annotations.

## [1.5.0] - 2022-11-25

### Added


- [Citeable in Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/50511298)!
- New extra dependency groups for install as `pip install pymech[opt]` and `pip
  install pymech[vtk]` respectively. There is also a `[full]` group which
  implies both `[opt]` and `[vtk]`.
- {doc}`asv_bench/README` in documentation.
- Dataclass {class}`pymech.neksuite.field.Header` using [`attrs`](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/) for reading file headers
- Function {func}`pymech.neksuite.field.read_header`
- Module {mod}`pymech.meshtools` for manipulating meshes
- Xarray backend ``pymech``. See {ref}`dataset`
- Function {func}`pymech.neksuite.readma2`

### Changed

- Attributes `lr1` and `var` {class}`pymech.core.Elem` are tuples instead of lists
- Attributes of {class}`pymech.core.DataLims` are now immutable tuples
- {func}`pymech.dataset.open_mfdataset` is now a partial function. This change should be fully backwards compatible
- {func}`pymech.neksuite.readnek` has a `dtype` option to set the floating point data type.
- {mod}`pymech.neksuite` is now a sub-package with three modules.

### Deprecated

- Module {ref}`exadata` is deprecated in favour of {mod}`pymech.core`.
  See {ref}`exadata` for more information on migrating your code.
- Function {func}`pymech.vtksuite.exa2vtk` is deprecated in favour of {func}`pymech.vtksuite.hexa2vtk`.

### Removed

- Test data files from the ``pymech`` git repository. The files are now available at <https://github.com/eX-Mech/pymech-test-data/>

### Fixed

- Logging configuration which does not break other loggers.

## [1.4.1] - 2021-05-07

Backwards compatible release with a lot of housekeeping and some usability
improvements.  This will be the last release to support Python 3.6 and Xarray <
0.18.0

### Added

- Common function available from the top-level `import pymech as pm`
- Extras requirements to install `mayavi` and `rich` with
  `pip install 'pymech[full]'`
- Experimental {func}`pymech.vtksuite.writevtk`
- Environment variable PYMECH_DEBUG to control logging level. See {mod}`pymech.log`

### Changed

- Swap optional `colorlog` logger with `rich` in {mod}`pymech.log`
- Refresh {func}`pymech.vtksuite.exa2vtk` implementation on an experimental basis

### Fixed

- Format entire code base with `black`
- Improve docs

## [1.4.0] - 2020-11-16

### Added
- Functions `readre2` and `writere2` to read/write binary .re2 Nek5000 meshes

### Fixed
- indexing bug in the boundary conditions parameters in `readrea`

### Changed
- Ignore some invalid 'E' internal boundary conditions in `readrea`
  since they are written this way by re2torea and ignored by Nek5000.


## [1.3.3] - 2020-09-29

### Fixed
- Various fixes -- including writing element map, correct order for min/max
  metadata -- in `writenek`

### Added
- {meth}`pymech.core.HexaData.merge` to merge meshes together and build proper connectivity

## [1.3.2] - 2020-09-23

### Fixed
- `writenek` detects system endianness and byte-swaps arrays, if needed, before
writing

### Removed
- Warnings while reading/writing scalars

## [1.3.1] - 2020-09-17

### Changed
- use ndarray.tofile() for faster output

## [1.3.0.post0] - 2020-07-16

### Fixed
- Packaging issue of sdist and wheel. Now uses `find_packages` instead of package name.

## [1.3.0] - 2020-07-16

### Added
- Dataset module which extends xarray

### Changed
- Faster `readnek` function uses less for loops
- Lazy load {class}`pymech.core.DataLims` limits as properties
- Autogenerate documentation using sphinx extension `autodoc`

## [1.2.0] - 2020-03-18

### Added
- License GPL v3 or later

### Changed
- Miscellaneous improvements in documentation, testing and packaging
